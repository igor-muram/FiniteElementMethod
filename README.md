# FiniteElementMethod
The finite element method for a two-dimensional thermal problem for an elliptic equation in a Cartesian coordinate system.
The basic functions are cubic Lagrangian type on triangles.
Boundary conditions of the first and second types. 
The coefficients of the equation are constants on each finite element. 
The matrix of a system of linear equations is generated in a sparse row-column format. 
To solve SLAE, a locally optimal scheme with central diagonal preconditioning is used.
